# Mnemosyne

A terminal-based proofreader that helps refine your texts through a quiet interface.

## What it aims to be

- A TUI tool for working with text documents, paragraph by paragraph
- An AI-assisted writing environment (left panel: conversation, right panel: document)
- A simple internal versioning system (no git dependency)

## What it actually is (for now)

A learning project. An excuse to finally give Rust a fair chance, or rather, to let Rust give me one.

The goal is to build something useful while actually getting the 'kung-fu' of ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and all those things that tripped me up before. This time with a real project, not abstract exercises.

## Status

Early. Very early. Two panels on a screen and a lot of curiosity.

## Usage

```bash
cargo run -- path/to/document.md
```
